# StGeorge
Disease-specific instrument designed to measure impact on overall health in patients with obstructive airways disease.

# What is the St Georgeâ€™s Respiratory Questionnaire?

The SGRQ is designed to measure health impairment in patients with asthma and COPD. It
is also valid for use in bronchiectasis and has been used successfully in patients with
kyphoscoliosis and sarcoidosis. There is a report of its validation in a small study of adults
with cystic fibrosis (Archivos de Bronconeumologia Volume 43, Issue 4, April 2007, pages
205-211). It is in two parts. Part I produces the Symptoms score, and Part 2 the Activity and
Impacts scores. A Total score is also produced.
